## Breakout Discussions

Friday, September 16, 2022, 2:15pm - 3pm ET

### The Role of Google Summer of Code within Research Software Engineering

*Valentina Staneva*

Google Summer of Code is a program aiming to introduce participants to open source software development and bring new members to open source communities. Apart from popular open source projects such as Git and PostgreSQL, many scientific research organizations have been involved in the program and have successfully mentored generations of students working on projects spanning areas such as astronomy, chemistry, bioinformatics, oceanography, etc. The goal of this breakout is to discuss the role a program like GSoC can play within the RSE communities. Potential topics include:

* Engaging and training software engineers with a passion to contribute to open source scientific projects
* Involving candidates from different backgrounds into domain specific RSE projects
* Mentoring and community building opportunities for full-time RSEs through such programs
* Strategies to diversify the pool of applicants, mentors and projects
* Sustainability of software and human efforts within such programs
* Implementation of successful GSoC components within localized internship programs

The breakout welcomes all members of the RSE community regardless of previous involvement in the GSoC program. The outcomes will be creating a sub-community interested in these topics, raising awareness of the program, and exchanging successful models for engaging and sustaining software engineering talent within the research communities.

### Encouraging and Enabling Mutual Ownership in a RSE Community of Practice

*Miranda Mundt, Jon Bisila, Reed Milewicz*

The explosion of Research Software Engineers (RSE) in the United States has exposed the necessity for communities of practice (CoP), groups which share a passion for an activity and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly, specifically to benefit their local organization or region. CoPs, however, only succeed insofar as their members feel heard, included, and valued. This breakout session will focus on how to encourage and enable a feeling of mutual ownership in a local RSE CoP.

Goals for this session are to generate actionable suggestions for those who want to create their own CoPs, to illuminate paths for connections between organizations, and to highlight mechanisms that encourage diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Potential topics for discussion include:

- How do you initiate a local CoP (logistic considerations)?
- How do you find people who might benefit from your CoP?
- How do you effectively engage with and incorporate potential community members?
- How do we encourage and enable those on the periphery to influence conversations,
regardless of preferred level of engagement?
- What processes exist for creating equal and equitable opportunities for participation?

### Identifying the top three challenges faced by RSEs in national laboratories

*Rinku Gupta*

Scientific software is a cornerstone of long-term collaboration and scientific progress, but software complexity is increasing due to disruptive changes in computer architectures and the challenges of next-generation science. Research software engineers (RSE) form an important and diverse community of people working on tackling these challenges. This breakout session will discuss challenges and opportunities for research software engineers, who use expertise in programming to advance research, specifically in domestic and international national laboratories.

RSE’s in national laboratories are unique when compared to other traditional software engineers because they work very closely with domain scientists to understand the domain-specific problem. They are, in several instances, required to be not only familiar with programming languages but also advanced topics related to software development lifecycles, software interoperability, performance analysis of software on large systems and advanced testing methodologies. In this breakout session, we would like to narrow down the “top three” of the common challenges faced by RSEs in national laboratories. This would give us a perspective on what issues are of most interest in the community. Our follow-on plan would be to solicit members from the audience who will help us tackle these challenges and work towards the goal of advancing science.
