## Registration is now open!

As our previous meetings and community calls, the virtual workshop will be held on Zoom. You can register for free [here](https://forms.gle/zEPeEK5Lo33BcpbD7). After filling out the Google form signup, you will be provided with a Zoom registration link. You will need to fill out the Zoom registration as well to receive a Zoom link to join the workshop! You will receive a copy of your registration to the email address you provide. Please check your spam folder if you don't receive one.

Registration will remain open up until the last day of the workshop but we encourage early registration for planning purposes.
